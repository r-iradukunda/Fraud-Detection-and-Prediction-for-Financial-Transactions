# Fraud Detection and Prediction for Financial Transactions

The **Fraud Transaction Detection System** is an AI-powered tool that helps banks detect and prevent fraudulent transactions **before they happen**. It analyzes transaction patterns and flags suspicious activity in real time.

---

## Overview

This system uses **machine learning** to learn from past transaction data (amount, location, time, etc.) and predict whether new transactions are **legitimate or fraudulent**.  
If fraud is suspected, the system **alerts bank staff** for further review.

---

## How It Works

1. **Data Input** â€“ Transactions are uploaded or entered manually.  
2. **Model Training** â€“ The AI learns normal vs. fraudulent behavior.  
3. **Prediction** â€“ Each new transaction is analyzed instantly.  
4. **Alert System** â€“ Suspicious activity triggers an alert before approval.
